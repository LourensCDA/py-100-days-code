# 100 Days of Code

This repository documents my coding journey. While I haven't strictly followed the 100 days schedule, it showcases my progress and projects along the way.

I've worked on Python for at least 10 years, starting when 2.7 was the latest version. Over the years, I've explored various libraries.

I worked through the course on Udemy by Angela Yu, which was done more for fun as I have added specific repeat use cases for python that does not always give you exposure to all aspects.
